A 2D Unity platformer where you play as a small robot navigating through a series of challenging levels using jump and double jump mechanics.

### Description

The game will consist of **two sets of levels**, each introducing new gameplay mechanics:

- **First set of levels**: Will include a horizontal platformer, a vertical platformer, and a third level combining both styles. At the end of the third level, the player will collect a **token** that unlocks the **double jump** ability.  
- **Second set of levels**: Will have a similar structure to the first set, but will be designed specifically to challenge the player using the newly acquired **double jump**.

Each level will feature **unique game assets** for visual variety and progression.

The robot character will have basic animations: running, jumping and idle.
