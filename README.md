‚ùóÔ∏è **Currently in development**

A 2D Unity platformer where you play as a **small robot** with the goal of **reaching a specially marked platform** in each level.

---

### Description

The game will consist of **two sets of levels**, each introducing new gameplay mechanics:

- **First set of levels** will include a **horizontal platformer**, a **vertical platformer**, and a third level **combining both styles.** At the end of the third level, the player will collect a **token** that unlocks the **double jump** ability.  
- **Second set of levels** will have a similar structure to the first set, but will be designed specifically to challenge the player using the newly acquired double jump.

Each level will feature **unique game assets** for visual variety.

The robot will have basic animations: running, jumping and idle.
